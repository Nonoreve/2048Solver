# 2048Solver
Project for college in were we try to create a automated 2048 player. 
The code is in python an spreads in several tests :
  engine and graphics packages build a playable 2048 game
  solver contains two parts:
    an algorithm trying to solve the game with lots of maths
    an algorythm that use an AI to do the hard work.
 
Some parts works independently, waiting for all to be merge together. 
This project will probably never be finished because the dead line is over :(
